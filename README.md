# NextJs Health Check

This is a simple Next.js application that provides a health check endpoint. It can be used to verify that the application is running and responsive.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Usage

Enter an API URL in the input field and click "Fetch Data" to check if the endpoint is accessible and detect any CORS errors.
